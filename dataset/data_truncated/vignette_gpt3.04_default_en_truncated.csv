The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the ethics literature since then.

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""trolley problem"", which was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It involves a trolley (tram) that is heading towards a group of five people standing on a track, and the question is: ""Is it morally acceptable to turn the trolley onto a different track so that it will kill only one person instead of five?""

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately turn the trolley onto another track where it would kill one person. The question is: Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to at least 1967. In the original version of the problem, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to throw a large man onto the track into its path. The large man will die if you do this, but he will stop the trolley and save the five people.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a different track. However, there is a single person on the side track. The question is: Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley, killing one person to save five?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem. In the original version, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a different track. However, there is a single fat man standing on the side track.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which one imagines being in a situation in which one could either allow a runaway trolley to kill five people or deliberately turn the trolley onto another track where it would kill one person. The term ""trolley problem"" was coined by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"" (1985).

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""footbridge dilemma"", which was introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her article ""The Trolley Problem"" (1985). In the footbridge dilemma, one imagines being on a footbridge over the tracks, in a situation in which one could either push a fat man off the bridge onto the tracks below, or refrain from doing so, in order to stop the trolley from killing five people.

The trolley problem is a variation of the footbridge dilemma, in which the fat man is replaced by a large man standing on a switch that would turn the trolley onto a side track, killing one person rather than five.

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person. Should you turn the trolley, or do nothing and allow it to kill the five people?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""fat man"" problem, which dates back to the 19th century. In the original version, a fat man standing on a footbridge must be pushed off in order to stop a trolley from running over five people on the track below. The trolley problem is a more modern version of the same problem, in which the fat man has been replaced by a switch.

The thought experiment is this:

Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks.

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic thought experiment known as the ""trolley problem"", which was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967. The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It involves a runaway trolley barreling down a track towards five people tied up on the track. The only way to save them is to throw a switch that will divert the trolley onto a different track. However, there is a single person tied up on the side track. Should you throw the switch, killing one person to save five?

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, and has been much discussed in the literature on practical ethics. It is a thought experiment in which a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one person.

The thought experiment is this:

Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley in this situation?

The trolley problem is a variation of the classic ""footbridge"" problem, which was first introduced by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1971. In the original footbridge problem, there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.

2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

In this case, most people agree that it is morally permissible to pull the lever and divert the trolley, saving the five people on the main track.
